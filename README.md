# iotools
This library is for setting up and controlling I/O in 8-bit AVRs (avr-gcc).  A function is used to create a pointer to a structure, which contains pointers to the register addresses for the associated I/O.  Functions are then passed the pointer for the I/O and whatever additional arguments are required.
